# mouse
A pattern memorization game.

Usage: Select a mode from the homescreen. Mode is the amount of grids that each step in each pattern would consist of. Random mode randomizes this amount. After the selection (and the original window closes), click on any grid to start, and a mouse will appear on a grid -- regardless of whether you "hit" it or not. However, the pattern will be periodic, and your job is to try to hit the most amount of mouses, using the pattern you found in the first few clicks. The length of a cycle is not shown.

The code is written in late December 2023 and some refactors are done in late June 2025.

## Rebasement

On June 23, 2025, I realized that the app icon image I had previously used infringed the copyright of an iStock photo. The image was found online without proper attribution, and I was unaware of its licensing restrictions at the time.

I replaced the images with new copies, shortly after the original was pushed.

I sincerely apologize for this oversight. While the potential impact of this infringement is likely minimal given the short timeframe and low resolution, I fully acknowledge the seriousness of copyright compliance.

If the copyright holder wishes to pursue any action, I will cooperate accordingly.

John
